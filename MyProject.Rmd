## Introduction ==================================================

This Shiny application shows a bar char of the number of Deaths in Virginia in 1940.

The user select a Population Group (Rural/Male, Rural/Female, Urban/Male and Urban/Female) from the dropbox.

The app then shows a bar chart with corresponding Age Group: 50-54, 55-59, 60-64, 65-69, 70-74

## Data ========================================================

- This app uses the 'VADeaths' dataset in the 'datasets' package. 'VADeaths' stores the Death Rates per 1000 population of Virginia in 1940. 
- They are cross-classified by age group (rows) and population group (columns).
```{r}
library(datasets)
summary(VADeaths)
```

## How it works ======================================================

- The user selects a Population Group from the dropbox.
- The bar char is automatically generated accordingly
- The bar chart is automatically refreshed each time when a new selection is made.

## Sample Report when user selection = "Rural Male" - Slide with Plot


```{r}
colors = c("red", "brown", "blue", "darkgray", "magenta")

# Plot the bar chart.
barplot(VADeaths[,1],ylab="Death Rate per 1000 population",
                xlab="Age Group",
                col=colors)


```
